0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
This was my ALX project on search algorithms. I implemented various types of search algorithms and stated the corresponding space/time complexities for each.

Tests ✔️
tests: Folder of test files for all tasks. Provided by ALX.
Helper Files 🙌
listint: Folder of helper files for task 12, singly linked list jump search.

create_list.c: C function that creates a listint_t singly linked list.
free_list.c: C function that frees a listint_t singly linked list.
print_list.c: C function that prints the contents of a listint_t singly linked list.
skiplist: Folder of helper files for task 13, singly skipped list jump search.

create_skiplist.c: C function that creates a skiplist_t singly skipped list.
free_skiplist.c: C function that frees a skiplist_t singly skipped list.
print_skiplist.c: C function that prints the contents of a skiplist_t singly skipped list.
